# Things needed in the Fracture Engine

## Engine general:
- [x] Test if the game can be loaded as a DLL in debug and statically linked in release
    - [x] Game builds as a DLL in debug builds and is loaded dynamically
    - [x] Everything is statically linked in release builds
- [ ] logging
    - [x] Create basic logging functionality
    - [x] Make logs coloured based on log level
    - [x] Move logging to the core library 
    - [ ] Fix all the missing debug asserts removed when log was moved to core
    - [ ] Change the log function to also optionally write to a log file in addition to console
    - [ ] Seperate log thread? job?
        - [ ] Could this be done by having a logger that has a memory arena and adds data to a buffer and every second dumps the data into the log and reset the arena. After max logs are written there is no allocations.
- [ ] Memory System
    - [x] Create a tracking allocator that resolves to a normal allocator in release
    - [x] Add allocators to the context passed to the game. One GPA and one FrameArena
    - [x] Move memory into core
    - [x] Remove merge enums from memory and let the game handle it's own memory
    - [ ] Create a custom allocator for Fracture that allows larger virtual space allocations for expanding allocations
- [ ] windows platform layer
    - [x] Create a window
    - [ ] Support multiple windows
    - [ ] Handles events and dispatch to the event system
- [ ] Event system
    - [x] Basic event handling and types
    - [x] Move event system into core as type
    - [x] Move event state into Engine
    - [ ] Make sure that when the DLL is reloaded the event listerers are still valid
    - [ ] We need additional context for the listener and sender since most game functions are stateless
        - [ ] Maybe the game can have it's own event handler and can be called by the event system instead of having to connect directly
    - [ ] Create multiple lists for handling frame future events and timed events
        - [ ] Create an EventData pool for the deffered events storage
    - [ ] Does the event system need the idea of layers so that certain handlers get first shot at handling events
    - [ ] Do permanent events need a seperate structure?
    - [ ] Priority queue for deferred events?
- [ ] Input system
- [ ] Signal System
    - [ ] Decide if there is a need for signal plug and socket system.
- [ ] SIMD Math Library
- [ ] Containers
    - [ ] StaticArrayList: Partially implemented
    - [ ] Array backed linked list?
    - [ ] Array backed memory pool?
    - [ ] Create a static multiarrayList
- [ ] Instrumentation
- [ ] Renderer
- [ ] Jobs System
- [x] Move types into core
- [x] Application and platform should be part of entry point
