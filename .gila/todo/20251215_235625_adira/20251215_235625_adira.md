Need a tool to help generate levels. This will need to also set masks for different types
of terrains, eg. walkable, impassable, impassable but projectiles can go through, etc. As well as providing locations
for specific events to be able to span as well as posssible spawn locations for enemies. I will not be doing complete
random generation. I will use the PoE approach of creating a template for a level and then generating variations based
on this template and at runtime choose one variation to load.
